My personal website

## `Main` Branch
This is the `main` branch! It is a barebones version of my personal site that can be run without any extra dependencies aside from what's in the `package.json`. You can view the fully customized production branch at this link: [https://github.com/joshdplo/joshdplo.me/tree/josh](https://github.com/joshdplo/joshdplo.me/tree/josh).

## Running Locally
This is an Astro site. If you haven't used Astro yet, they have a [great tutorial to follow](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/). This project was creating using node >= v22.0.0 - it will most likely work on a lot of node versions, but v22 is the only version that's been tested.

1. install dependencies | `npm i`
2. run locally | `npm start`
3. preview (you must build first) | `npm run build`, `npm run preview`
