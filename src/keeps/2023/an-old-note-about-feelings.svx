summary: Feelings are hard

Sometimes there's feelings in your body and you don't know what to do with them and I don't 
really know either so let's think about it together and maybe we can figure it out.

## Good Feelings
Some feelings are good feelings, like happy happy yay yay and wee wee wee all the way home.

## Bad Feelings
Some feelings are bad feelings like ouchy and yow and wtf and cry cry sad.
