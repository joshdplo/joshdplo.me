This is the very first watches of the month, where I recall some sweet things I watched...this month. Very creative titling right?! These are movies and shows from all time, and there isn't any specific order to them.

Holy moly Severance is such a great show! This month I watched the second season. My friend kmbo told me about it when it first came out and my draw dropped to the floor when I watched it. It is so cool - the story is wild and I was on the edge of my seat every single episode. I had been waiting what seemed like forever for the second season and I'm so happy that I finally got to see it.

I loved ACV! I don't personally use social media, so I'm constantly fascinated by stories about how it affect peoples' lives for better or worse. In this case, it was definitely a worse. I also love [Alycia Debnam-Carey](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/1129464-alycia-debnam-carey) - [The Lost Flowers of Alice Heart](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/125816-the-lost-flowers-of-alice-hart) is one of my favorite mini-series in the whole wide world, not to mention the other great movies (and series) she has been in!

Speaking of The Lost Flowers of Alice Heart, Sigourney Weaver was also in The Gorge! I really liked this movie - it was a cute romance with fun action and a groovy story. Anya Taylor-Joy is another actress that is in some really cool roles; there are so many good ones, but I'll just mention [The Northman](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/639933-the-northman) - it was my favorite movie of 2022.

Mo was so good! I hadn't watched the first season, but saw the second season was reccomended so I ended up watching both. There were tons of funny moments as well as touching moments, and I loved all of the characters.

Mariko-sama! I didn't hear of Shogun when it initially came out, but I'm so glad I heard of it this month. It was a wild ride that I won't forget any time soon - the characters, the story, the setting...everything about this show was memorable and awesome.

I am a die-hard [Orphan Black]() fan - my uncle told me about it when it was still live and I ended up watching it just as it was ending. I've watched the original series over twice now - it's just such a unique and amazing show. OB Echoes isn't super similar to the original, but it was a fun ride and I liked how they brought back a couple of the original characters. The icing on the cake for me was [Krysten Ritter](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/78080-krysten-ritter) - I will watch anything with her in it. I first saw her in [Jessica Jones](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/38472-marvel-s-jessica-jones) and thought she was so cool.
