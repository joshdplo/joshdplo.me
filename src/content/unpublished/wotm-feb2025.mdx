This is the very first watches of the month, where I recall some sweet things I watched...this month. Very creative titling right?!

I loved ACV! I don't personally use social media, so I'm constantly fascinated by stories about how it affect peoples' lives for better or worse. In this case, it was definitely a worse. I also love [Alycia Debnam-Carey](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/1129464-alycia-debnam-carey) - [The Lost Flowers of Alice Heart](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/125816-the-lost-flowers-of-alice-hart) is one of my favorite mini-series in the whole wide world, not to mention the other great movies (and series) she has been in!

Speaking of The Lost Flowers of Alice Heart, Sigourney Weaver was also in The Gorge! I really liked this movie - it was a cute romance with fun action and a groovy story. Anya Taylor-Joy is another actress that is in some really cool roles; there are so many good ones, but I'll just mention [The Northman](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/639933-the-northman) - it was my favorite movie of 2022.
