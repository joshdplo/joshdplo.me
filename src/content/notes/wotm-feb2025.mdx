This February was a good schmonth for schmovie watching - lots of really cool movies and shows that I'm super duper glad I got the chance to see!

Mo was so good! I hadn't watched the first season, but saw the second season was recommended so I ended up watching both. There were tons of funny moments as well as touching moments, and I loved all of the characters.

Mariko-sama! I didn't hear of Shogun when it initially came out, but I'm so glad I heard of it this month. It was a wild ride that I won't forget any time soon - the characters, the story, the setting...everything about this show was memorable and awesome.

I am a die-hard [Orphan Black](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/56296-orphan-black) fan - my uncle told me about it when it was still live and I ended up watching it just as it was ending. I've watched the original series over twice now - it's just such a unique and amazing show. OB Echoes isn't super similar to the original, but it was a fun ride and I liked how they brought back a couple of the original characters. The icing on the cake for me was [Krysten Ritter](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/78080-krysten-ritter) - I will watch anything with her in it. I first saw her in [Jessica Jones](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/38472-marvel-s-jessica-jones) and thought she was so cool.

I loved ACV! I don't personally use social media, so I'm constantly fascinated by stories about how it affect peoples' lives for better or worse. In this case, it was definitely a worse. I also love [Alycia Debnam-Carey](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/1129464-alycia-debnam-carey) - [The Lost Flowers of Alice Heart](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/125816-the-lost-flowers-of-alice-hart) is one of my favorite mini-series in the whole wide world, not to mention the other great movies (and series) she has been in!

Speaking of The Lost Flowers of Alice Heart, [Sigourney Weaver](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/10205-sigourney-weaver) was also in The Gorge! I really liked this movie - it was a cute romance with fun action and a groovy story. [Anya Taylor-Joy](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/1397778-anya-taylor-joy) is another actress that plays some really cool roles; there are so many good ones, but I'll just mention [The Northman](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/639933-the-northman), which was my favorite movie of 2022!

Holy moly Severance is such a great show! This month I began on the second season. My friend kmbo told me about it when it first came out and my draw dropped to the floor when I watched it. It is so cool - the story is wild and I was on the edge of my seat every single episode. I had been waiting what seemed like forever for the second season and I'm so happy that it's finally been released!

My friend kush told me to watch this one and jeeeeeeeeeez! The Brutalist was *long*; spacious; ominous; a bit intense; a little uncomfortable; and fancy, which was quite the combination, and they pulled it off. It was certainly a memorable movie with top-tier acting.

And that's it - I'm looking forward to March and all of the nutty tales it's gonna bring!
