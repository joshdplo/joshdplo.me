import CollectionItem from '@components/CollectionItem.astro';

Collection items from all `likes` collections can now be embedded in notes! They can be included in `.mdx` posts using the new component `<CollectionItem>`. Here's an example of a movie collection item:
<CollectionItem category="movies" itemId="348" text="Plain text can also be passed through to give some context for the item being included!" />

Here is an example of a show:
<CollectionItem category="shows" itemId="39793" />

Here is an example of a band:
<CollectionItem category="bands" itemId="7DjwIxbe8kpw4pqnzAMoin" />

Here is an example of a song:
<CollectionItem category="songs" itemId="4niDU35YEMnJIQjKb506hb" />

And finally, an example of a game!
<CollectionItem category="games" itemId="1086940" />

Pretty nifty! This component can be used everywhere now, not just inside of mdx files, so maybe it will come in handy on a different part of the site.
