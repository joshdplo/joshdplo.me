import CollectionItem from '@components/CollectionItem.astro';

Individual items from all [likes](/likes) collections (movies, shows, music, games) now have their own component! This means they can be included in `.mdx` files (notes) using the new component `<CollectionItem>`.

Here's an example of a movie collection item...
```js
<CollectionItem category="movies" itemId="348" text="Plain text can also be passed through to give some context for the item being included!" />
```
<CollectionItem category="movies" itemId="348" text="Plain text can also be passed through to give some context for the item being included!" />

Here is an example of a show...
```js
<CollectionItem category="shows" itemId="39793" />
```
<CollectionItem category="shows" itemId="39793" />

Here is an example of a band...
```js
<CollectionItem category="bands" itemId="7DjwIxbe8kpw4pqnzAMoin" />
```
<CollectionItem category="bands" itemId="7DjwIxbe8kpw4pqnzAMoin" />

Here is an example of a song...
```js
<CollectionItem category="songs" itemId="4niDU35YEMnJIQjKb506hb" />
```
<CollectionItem category="songs" itemId="4niDU35YEMnJIQjKb506hb" />

And finally, an example of a game!
```js
<CollectionItem category="games" itemId="1086940" />
```
<CollectionItem category="games" itemId="1086940" />

Pretty nifty! This component can be used everywhere now, not just inside of mdx files, so maybe it will come in handy on a different part of the site.
