Joshdplo.me version one is live!@@!!@@!#!#!@!!  
The goals were: make something I will **actually use**, and learn while doing it. Goals accomplished ðŸ˜Ž. 
The code needs *tons* of improvements, but it's mine and I'm proud of it all the same. Now 
it's time to feel groovy about the work that's been done, start using the site, and go from there.

## Version 1
Here are the credits for version 1 - thanks to all of the very sharp people who make these cool tools. 
Since there are 2 projects for this site (the website, and then the data), I'm including them both.

**[Website](https://github.com/joshdplo/joshdplo.me)**
- Tech
  - built with [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
  - using [vite](https://vite.dev/)
  - using [sveltekit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction)
  - using [mdsvex](https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX)
  - using [sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Code References
  - [Sveltekit tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/kit/introducing-sveltekit)
    - is great to learn the basics and then i was referencing it during the build a ton
  - [Josh Collinsworth's sveltekit blog starter](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/sveltekit-blog-starter/tree/main)
    - extremely helpful to see the source,and really liked the hyperlegible font (decided to use it here!)
  - [This stackoverflow post by brunnerh](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76147868)
    - so simple and easy - haven't used vite tons, so didn't realize this was an option

**[Slurpi (Data)](https://github.com/joshdplo/slurpi)**
Slurpi is a tool I made to save media information into a database so I could then 
add to it, sort it, and use it. Eventually it will be added into the website repo, but 
monorepos are confusing and that's a project for another day.
